### Major Changes

- [`d6fe117`](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/commit/d6fe117ea712a41e6118f0cb4e84799817ee8d21) Thanks [@OneEyed1366](https://github.com/OneEyed1366)! - `DEFAULT_END_REACHED_THRESHOLD`, `DEFAULT_START_REACHED_THRESHOLD` and `visiblePercent` are gone from
  `@symbiote-native/components`. The first two were one RN default standing in for another, replaced by
  `DEFAULT_EDGE_REACHED_THRESHOLD_PX`; the third split in two and neither half is the old function.

  `onEndReached` fired two screens early. RN has two defaults here and we conflated them:
  `onEndReachedThresholdOrDefault`'s `?? 2` is a multiple of the visible length, used for render-ahead
  windowing, while the unset-case fallback deciding whether to actually FIRE is a flat 2 pixels
  (`VirtualizedList.js:1567`). An app passing no threshold gets the pixel answer now.

  Viewability precedence was inverted. `itemVisiblePercentThreshold` is a fraction of the CELL,
  `viewAreaCoveragePercentThreshold` a fraction of the VIEWPORT, so a short cell fully on screen clears
  the first easily and can fail the second. Vendor checks the area config first (`ViewabilityHelper.js`);
  we checked the item config. Its `_isEntirelyVisible` shortcut comes along, and a callback shared across
  several `viewabilityConfigCallbackPairs` is now told which config fired.

  Both `keyExtractor` defaults were wrong: the flat one is `item.key ?? item.id ?? String(index)`
  (`VirtualizeUtils.js:248`), and a section's own extractor beats the list-level one
  (`VirtualizedSectionList.js:305`).

  `RefreshControl` sends `setNativeRefreshing` only when `refreshing` did not change under it
  (`:139-158`) - the case that exists to stop the spinner drifting out of sync with the app.

  `Animated.parallel` crashed on a falsy array entry, the shape `cond && timing(...)` produces; vendor
  treats it as already finished (`AnimatedImplementation.js`'s `parallelImpl`). An `AnimatedValueXY` used
  straight as an `event()` mapping target worked only because the generic object walk happened to reach
  `x` and `y` - deliberate now, with a test.

### Minor Changes

- [#71](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/pull/71) [`204bb30`](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/commit/204bb30a61d378aea7dab9f8983e198f1e578023) Thanks [@OneEyed1366](https://github.com/OneEyed1366)! - Add the structure seam a COMPOSED host primitive needs: `IHostBehavior.buildStructure` and
  `ISymbioteNode.childHost`.

  `foldPayload` gives a tag its wrapper's prop mapping. Nothing gave it the wrapper's composition, so
  a primitive built from more than one node — ScrollView is a scroll view wrapping a content view —
  could not become a tag at all, whatever its props did.

  A behavior may now build its own internal subtree once at attach and return the node the app's
  children belong under. `appendChild` / `insertBefore` / `removeChild` redirect there, so an adapter
  keeps naming the owner and never learns a slot exists — the same relationship a browser's `<video>`
  has with its UA shadow tree.

  `IHostBehavior.slotProps` is the prop twin: owner prop name -> slot prop name, applied in
  `routeProp` and gated on the same field, so an app writes `contentContainerStyle` on the ScrollView
  and it lands as the content node's `style`. A pure rename — precedence belongs to a `payloadFold`,
  because the two orders are opposite (the scroll node's base style goes UNDER the app's, the
  content node's `flexDirection: 'row'` goes OVER it).

  Also lands `registerScrollViewBehavior()` in `@symbiote-native/components`, the first consumer: it
  builds the same two nodes and composes the same two style arrays every adapter's wrapper does. It
  is exported but called by nothing — `scroll-view` is the tag the wrappers already emit and they
  build their own content node, so a global registration would double-nest every existing ScrollView.
  Making the engine the single owner of the content node is the next step.

- [`d6fe117`](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/commit/d6fe117ea712a41e6118f0cb4e84799817ee8d21) Thanks [@OneEyed1366](https://github.com/OneEyed1366)! - Every item here is a place the press family answered differently from `react-native@0.86`, found by
  reading its source.

  Two controls fired backwards. `Switch` called `onValueChange` before `onChange` (`Switch.js:201-207`),
  `TextInput` called `onChangeText` before `onChange` (`TextInput.js:504-506`). Vendor fires the event
  handler first, so an app reading `event.nativeEvent` to accept or reject a value saw it after the
  value had been announced. `_onSelectionChange` had the same inversion (`:522-533`).

  `disabled` was only ever the raw prop. All three touchables resolve `disabled ?? aria-disabled ??
accessibilityState.disabled` before configuring Pressability (`TouchableOpacity.js:186` and siblings;
  Highlight has no `aria` leg, an upstream inconsistency matched rather than fixed). A control disabled
  through `accessibilityState` alone greyed out and kept firing `onPress`.

  The long-press timer is armed at `RESPONDER_GRANT`, so its threshold from touch-down is a flat 500 ms
  instead of 500 ms after press-in settles (`Pressability.js:471-478`). Movement is gated by a separate
  10 px jitter threshold, checked before the retention region (`:502-508`).

  `blockNativeResponder` is new across the family. `onResponderGrant` returns it (`Pressability.js:479`)
  to tell native to stand down, so a parent `ScrollView` cannot steal a claimed gesture mid-drag. We sent
  the default and yielded.

  `touchSoundDisabled` is new too, reaching Pressability as `android_disableSound`. It gates the Android
  release-time `SoundManager.playTouchSound()` (`:749-757`), a call that did not exist here - hence the
  new `SoundManager` engine module.

  `Pressable`'s bare tag commits `collapsable: false` unconditionally (`Pressable.js:340`). `Switch`
  claims the responder on both platforms (`:238-239,288-289`) and builds `accessibilityState` only once
  `disabled` resolves to something (`:235-238`). Both are tag rules in `SymbioteFabricProps.cpp`; the
  adapters gained prop declarations and nothing else.

- [`d6fe117`](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/commit/d6fe117ea712a41e6118f0cb4e84799817ee8d21) Thanks [@OneEyed1366](https://github.com/OneEyed1366)! - The same vendor read, applied to the view primitives.

  `InputAccessoryView` renders `null` on Android. We committed a real, laid-out `RCTView` and its whole
  subtree there. `VOID_COMPONENT` is the engine primitive for it: where `ANCHOR_COMPONENT` hoists its
  children up in its place, a void node contributes neither itself nor them.

  `Image` gets three vendor rules back. `defaultSource` resolves through `resolveAssetSource` like every
  other source slot (`ImageViewNativeComponent.js:138`), `alt` sets `accessible` unconditionally
  (`Image.android.js:272-273`), and the four load events stay silent on Android until
  `shouldNotifyLoadEvents` is on - vendor raises it whenever any one of them is authored, which is what
  `IMAGE_LOAD_EVENT_NAMES` answers.

  `ImageBackground` carries `importantForAccessibility` down to both of its nodes; vendor destructures it
  out of the spread and reapplies it explicitly (`:67,76,82`).

  `Modal` pinned its container to the left edge always - vendor picks the edge off `I18nManager.isRTL`
  (`Modal.js:372`). `ActivityIndicator` never sent Android `styleAttr` and `indeterminate` (`:100-103`),
  so the spinner took whatever the ViewManager defaulted to. `KeyboardAvoidingView` uses vendor's own
  duration formula, floor included (`:169-179`).

  `TouchableWithoutFeedback` needs `nativeID` to beat `id`, the reverse of every other tag.
  `IHostBehavior.nativeIdWinsOverId` says so once at `createElement` instead of each writer guessing.

  `core/components/host-primitives.cjs`, the spec every adapter reads for a primitive's intrinsic tag,
  prop aliases and defaults. Without an entry a tag carries none of its folds, however completely its
  runtime behavior already lives on the engine node.

- [#71](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/pull/71) [`204bb30`](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/commit/204bb30a61d378aea7dab9f8983e198f1e578023) Thanks [@OneEyed1366](https://github.com/OneEyed1366)! - Two engine seams a composed host primitive needs, and ScrollView's prop half wired onto them.

  `IHostBehavior.slotDerived` names owner props the internal slot's payload is computed from, so a
  write to one marks the slot dirty. `markPropsDirty` bubbles up, so without it a derived slot value
  is correct at mount and frozen forever after. Read past `setProp`'s identity guard, so a re-render
  writing an unchanged value still costs nothing.

  `IHostBehavior.onOwnedListenerChange` fires when the app wires or unwires an owned listener — never
  on the fresh closure a framework hands over each render. `afterCommit` cannot serve this: a listener
  change moves no Fabric prop, so the commit after it is a no-op and post-commit hooks are skipped.

  A `<scroll-view>` now resolves `decelerationRate` to the platform friction constant, turns off
  content-cell flattening for `maintainVisibleContentPosition` / `snapToAlignment`, and synthesizes
  `onContentSizeChange` from its content view's layout — installing that gated `onLayout` only when
  the app passed a handler, as RN and every wrapper do.

- [#71](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/pull/71) [`204bb30`](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/commit/204bb30a61d378aea7dab9f8983e198f1e578023) Thanks [@OneEyed1366](https://github.com/OneEyed1366)! - A `<scroll-view>` can now pin a `<sticky-header>` child, the last piece a composed host primitive
  needed before its wrapper could be deleted.

  RN's sticky header is JS-built (`ScrollViewStickyHeader`), not a native concept — a plain view
  carrying `zIndex` and an animated `translateY` computed from scroll offset against the header's own
  measured layout. `registerScrollViewBehavior`'s owner now tracks sticky-header children through the
  new `sticky` claim mode, and `core/components/src/behaviors/scroll-view/sticky.ts` runs the
  offset/pin math that every wrapper used to duplicate. `<sticky-header>` and its Fabric name join the
  platform-invariant tables in `component-names/{index.ios,index.android,shared}.ts`.

  Angular's `babel-register-composed.cjs` picks up the new tag.

  `focus` / `blur` / `measure`.

  A `<scroll-view>` hands the app its engine node, with no wrapper to build an imperative handle
  from — so anything the wrapper's handle offered has to be reachable from the node, or the public
  surface silently shrinks the day the primitive stops being a component.

  `buildScrollViewHandle` keeps its signature and now delegates to those methods instead of
  dispatching its own commands. The defaults (`x`/`y` 0, `animated` true) live in one place, so a ref
  and a tag cannot disagree about what `scrollTo()` with no argument means.

### Minor Changes

- [#72](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/pull/72) [`022b9fd`](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/commit/022b9fdcc39640e6b99ddc9068242d9ac41bbd5f) Thanks [@OneEyed1366](https://github.com/OneEyed1366)! - A claimed child can now become the owner's PARENT, which is what an Android RefreshControl is.

  An Android ScrollView holds exactly one child, so a sibling refresh control is an `addViewAt`
  crash — RN inverts the tree there instead of beside-placing like it does on iOS. `claimedChildren`
  carries a mode per name, `beside` or `wrap`, and `ISymbioteNode.wrapper` records the inversion. The
  adapter goes on naming the scroll view for every insert, prop write and command; only the two
  structural entry points know a wrapper is what the tree holds.

  `IHostBehavior.onWrapChange` is where a behavior answers for it. The wrapper is the app's own node,
  so nothing could have given it a payload fold at creation — this is where the scroll view's layout
  style moves up to it and its visual style stays below.

  `splitScrollViewStyle` composes the axis base onto BOTH boxes, as RN does. All five adapters had
  dropped it from the wrapper, so an `AndroidSwipeRefreshLayout` with no explicit user layout style
  lost `flexGrow: 1` and collapsed to its content height inside a flex parent.

  `insertBefore`'s `beforeChild` is typed nullable, which is what its callers always passed.

- [#72](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/pull/72) [`022b9fd`](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/commit/022b9fdcc39640e6b99ddc9068242d9ac41bbd5f) Thanks [@OneEyed1366](https://github.com/OneEyed1366)! - `IHostBehavior.claimedChildren` keeps a named child on the owner instead of redirecting it into the
  internal slot, and places it before that slot.

  A ScrollView's RefreshControl is a sibling of the content view rather than one of its children, and
  RN renders `{refreshControl}{contentContainer}` in that order. Claims are keyed by the child's
  Fabric component name: a claim is only consulted for children of one owner, so the name is
  unambiguous there and no node has to carry its intrinsic tag.

  `insertBefore` and `removeChild` read the same rule, so an adapter that names the owner both places
  a claimed child correctly and can take it away again.

  Android is not this shape and is not covered: there the refresh control wraps the scroll view, which
  needs a node above the owner rather than beside its slot.

- [#72](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/pull/72) [`022b9fd`](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/commit/022b9fdcc39640e6b99ddc9068242d9ac41bbd5f) Thanks [@OneEyed1366](https://github.com/OneEyed1366)! - Add `@symbiote-native/components/register`: every host behavior (`registerScrollViewBehavior`,
  `registerSwitchBehavior`, `registerTextInputBehavior`, the sticky-header and image behaviors, …)
  now registers from one shared module instead of five adapters each re-declaring the same call
  list in their own `register.ts`.

  The list had already drifted once between adapters before this landed — a behavior added for one
  framework and forgotten in another is now structurally impossible, since there is only one list to
  edit. `registerScrollViewBehavior()` itself is finally called for real (it existed since the
  structure-seam work but nothing invoked it while the wrappers still built their own content node);
  every adapter pulls it in through this entrypoint now that the wrappers are gone.

- [#72](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/pull/72) [`022b9fd`](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/commit/022b9fdcc39640e6b99ddc9068242d9ac41bbd5f) Thanks [@OneEyed1366](https://github.com/OneEyed1366)! - Add the structure seam a COMPOSED host primitive needs: `IHostBehavior.buildStructure` and
  `ISymbioteNode.childHost`.

  `foldPayload` gave a lowered primitive its wrapper's prop mapping. Nothing gave it the wrapper's
  composition, so a primitive built from more than one node — ScrollView is a scroll view wrapping a
  content view — could not be lowered at all, whatever its props did.

  A behavior may now build its own internal subtree once at attach and return the node the app's
  children belong under. `appendChild` / `insertBefore` / `removeChild` redirect there, so an adapter
  keeps naming the owner and never learns a slot exists — the same relationship a browser's `<video>`
  has with its UA shadow tree.

  `IHostBehavior.slotProps` is the prop twin: owner prop name -> slot prop name, applied in
  `routeProp` and gated on the same field, so an app writes `contentContainerStyle` on the ScrollView
  and it lands as the content node's `style`. A pure rename — precedence belongs to a `payloadFold`,
  because the two orders are opposite (the scroll node's base style goes UNDER the app's, the
  content node's `flexDirection: 'row'` goes OVER it).

  Also lands `registerScrollViewBehavior()` in `@symbiote-native/components`, the first consumer: it

  is exported but called by nothing — `symbiote-scroll-view` is the tag the wrappers already emit and
  they build their own content node, so a global registration would double-nest every existing
  ScrollView. Splitting the wrapper and lowered tags — the `symbiote-text-input` /
  `symbiote-text-input-managed` precedent — is the next step.

  `core/components/host-primitives.cjs`, the build-time spec Vue's and Solid's lowering transforms
  read to decide which JSX elements compile straight to the engine's mutation API instead of a
  framework component instance. Without an entry a primitive stays a component forever, however
  completely its runtime behavior already lives on the engine node — this is what let Vue's and
  Solid's own wrapper-retirement commits actually lower those three tags at build time rather than
  just delete the JS wrapper and leave the element uncompiled.

  intrinsic-element type table: every tag gets a loose attribute bag by default except the ones the
  adapter has a real per-tag prop type for, which get that type instead (`Omit` the crossed keys out
  of the loose record, merge the real ones back in). The mechanics were duplicated per adapter before
  this; only the prop types genuinely differ (`children`/`ref` are framework values, so a type like
  `IViewProps` can't be fully shared) — this generic lets an adapter's own table stay a one-line
  instantiation instead of re-deriving the `Omit<Record<...>, keyof Crossed> & Crossed` shape by hand.

  `View`, `Text`, `Image`, `SafeAreaView`, `InputAccessoryView`, `Switch`, `TextInput` and
  `Pressable` are lowered at build time on Vue, Svelte, Solid and Angular, so a screen no longer
  allocates a component instance, a props proxy, an anchor node or an LView per primitive. The
  import and the call site are unchanged — which primitive is internally a tag is invisible to an
  app.

  What moved down with them:

  - The state each primitive needs is an engine host behavior keyed on its tag, not a framework
    lifecycle. Press, switch, text-input, image and input-accessory-view all register one.
  - The prop folds a wrapper used to perform run on the payload instead — `id` to `nativeID`,
    `Text`'s `ellipsizeMode`/`allowFontScaling` defaults, `TextInput`'s `inputMode`/`readOnly`/
    `enterKeyHint`, `Pressable`'s `disabled` accessibility state and its Android ripple. A lowered
    element commits the same payload as its wrapper; `core/test-utils`' equivalence oracle asserts
    it per primitive.
  - The `aria-*`/`role` fold resolves in the engine, so it reaches every path rather than the
    fourteen component bodies that used to carry it.
  - A functional `style={({pressed}) => …}` is specialised into a resting/active pair at build time,
    so the idiom the ecosystem writes lowers as authored. A CSS `:active` rule is not required.

  A transform refuses where lowering would change what an app can observe: a spread on a stateful
  primitive, a render-prop child, an instance-bound directive, a runtime value choosing the
  intrinsic. All five transforms answer one shared fixture table, so a divergence is a failing row
  rather than a device-only surprise.

  React keeps its wrappers — it has no build-time analysis, and host and composite are both fibers —
  and exports the same names.

  Native 0.86 on React's own Fabric renderer: Solid is under stock on all eight benchmark rows,

### Patch Changes

- [#59](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/pull/59) [`2d34a11`](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/commit/2d34a115848c1062f0ae7f67840f0e81df1f754c) Thanks [@mustafa0x](https://github.com/mustafa0x)! - Derive internal peer compatibility from the current workspace package versions so packed
  manifests reject older engine and adapter releases that do not provide the APIs they import.

- [`255c37f`](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/commit/255c37fd02fea1fc0b5e8a1410fc6834b1a3c8d1) Thanks [@OneEyed1366](https://github.com/OneEyed1366)! - The engine-node press behavior joins the Pressability lifecycle contract the five wrappers already
  follow: it supplies the injected `now` the machine needs to time the 130 ms active-duration floor,
  and runs the machine's own teardown on detach.

  A lowered `<Pressable>` therefore holds its pressed look for the same floor a wrapped one does,
  instead of releasing on the touch-up event.

- [#62](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/pull/62) [`093144d`](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/commit/093144d13bc3278353388e4b38ec904bf541f881) Thanks [@mustafa0x](https://github.com/mustafa0x)! - Match React Native Pressability's delayed activation, retention-region re-entry, 130 ms plain
  Pressable active-duration floor, Touchable zero-floor override, and timer cleanup on framework
  teardown across all five adapters.
- Updated dependencies [[`fd70625`](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/commit/fd70625deff7d13c29a8606259a44f30249e040f), [`255c37f`](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/commit/255c37fd02fea1fc0b5e8a1410fc6834b1a3c8d1), [`6e6df80`](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/commit/6e6df80861f25d146c2b0d7c4837346dc0a86b16)]:
  - @symbiote-native/engine@0.4.0

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 3acd869: Add Solid.js as a supported framework: a new `@symbiote-native/solid` adapter reaching full
  component/runtime parity with the other four adapters, plus a `./solid` export subpath on every
  companion package. Engine and shared-component packages gained portal/tunnel, retained-tree
  census, and profiling infrastructure that the new adapter (and the others' portal/tunnel work
  landing alongside it) build on.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 388c353: Correct `Modal`'s `onOrientationChange` signature, which promised a payload it never delivered. The
  engine registers every `onX` listener as `(event: ISymbioteEvent) => handler(event)`, so a handler
  always receives the full wrapper. `onShow` / `onRequestClose` / `onDismiss` never noticed because
  they declare no argument, but `onOrientationChange` was typed against the unwrapped payload - a
  caller following the type read `event.orientation` and got `undefined` forever, while the value sat
  at `event.nativeEvent.orientation`.

  The handler is now typed `(event: ISymbioteEvent) => void` on every adapter, matching every other
  payload-carrying event in the codebase (`onLayout`, `onAccessibilityAction`, the press and scroll
  handlers), each of which narrows at the read site. `IModalOrientationChangeEvent` stays exported and
  is now documented as what it truthfully describes: the `nativeEvent` payload shape, not the handler
  argument.

  Code reading `event.orientation` will now fail to compile rather than silently receive `undefined`.
  Read `event.nativeEvent.orientation` instead.

  Angular additionally stops normalizing the event into `{ orientation }` - a divergence from the
  other three adapters that also swallowed the event entirely when the payload was not one of the two
  values it recognized.

### Patch Changes

- 388c353: Keep sticky headers correct when a cell is force-rendered. `VirtualizedList` can render a cell
  outside the normal virtualization flow — to satisfy `initialScrollIndex`, or to keep a focused row
  mounted — and the sticky-header reducer treated those cells as if they had arrived through the
  usual windowing path. The tracked header index then disagreed with what was actually mounted, and
  the wrong section header stuck (or none did) until the next ordinary scroll correction.

  The reducer now distinguishes force-rendered cells from windowed ones, and each adapter's
  `VirtualizedList` reports them as such.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 465c9e8: Extract two triplicated component machines into shared, framework-agnostic logic in
  `@symbiote-native/components`, completing the enriched three-layer split for the last two
  components that still re-implemented decision logic per adapter.

  Touchable: the TouchableOpacity press-scheduling machine (delayPressIn defer, early-release
  flush, activatedAt tracking, min-press-duration hold) and the TouchableHighlight underlay
  gating were re-implemented line-for-line in React, Vue, and Angular. They now live once as
  `createTouchableFeedbackRuntime` + `createTouchableFeedbackHandlers` (clock and scheduler
  injected, so the machine is testable and timer globals stay out of core) and
  `highlightPressedStyle`. Each adapter keeps only the `Animated.timing` opacity call, injected
  via `activate`/`deactivate`.

  ScrollView sticky headers: the per-header effect state machine (zero-swallow gate,
  rebuild-interpolation-on-input-change, debounce pick, cross-talk feed-forward) was hand-written
  in every adapter, and twice in Angular (component plus projection wrapper). It is now one
  `reduceSticky(state, action, inputs)` enriched reducer plus a `resolveScrollForwarding` decision
  helper that absorbs the onScroll branch, throttle defaults, inverted-height capture, and the
  collapsableChildren predicate. Angular's projection wrapper collapses to a thin effect-runner
  over the same reducer. Adapters keep only effect execution: the debounce timer, the
  interpolate/listener wiring, and the re-render trigger.

  Adapter prop surfaces and runtime behavior are unchanged; the rewrite is structural.

- 465c9e8: Extract the VirtualizedList orchestration into a shared, framework-agnostic `reduceList` state
  machine in `@symbiote-native/components`. Every list adapter (React, Vue, Angular) previously
  re-implemented the same after-commit effect skeleton — window recompute, `onEndReached`/
  `onStartReached` gating, viewability, batch fill, `maintainVisibleContentPosition`, the imperative
  scrolls — in its own reactive dialect, so the decision predicates (`last === count - 1`,
  `first === 0`, the batch-fill catch-up test, the viewability guards) lived three times and could
  drift. That logic is now one pure `reduceList(state, action) -> { state, effects }`; each adapter
  only maps native events to actions, holds one state cell, and executes the returned effects. Adds
  `reduceList`, `createInitialListState`, and `listEffectSignature` (plus their types) to the public
  `@symbiote-native/components` surface. Adapter prop surfaces and runtime behavior are unchanged —
  the rewrite is structural.

## 0.2.6

### Patch Changes

- 1791d13: Consolidate several independently-duplicated pieces of logic found during an architecture review, with no behavior change intended:

  - `isSymbioteEvent` now lives once in the engine (`node.ts`) and is shared by `core/components` and eight Angular components that each had their own copy (the shared guard narrows `nativeEvent` to a non-null object, slightly stricter than a couple of the old presence-only checks).
  - `core/components/src/state/scroll-routing-handle.ts` gives `VirtualizedList`/`SectionList` a shared `IScrollRoutingHandle` base; `layout-event.ts` centralizes reading a numeric field out of `nativeEvent.layout`, replacing three separate reimplementations in `ScrollView`/`VirtualizedList`.
  - A new `createDeviceEventModule` factory in the engine's `native-modules.ts` backs `AccessibilityInfo`, `AppState`, `Appearance`, `BackHandler`, `Dimensions`, and `Keyboard`, each keeping its own degrade policy.
  - `touch-history.ts` and the image pipeline (`image-loader.ts` statics, `image-source-resolver.ts`) are extracted out of `events/index.ts` and the `Image` view layer respectively, so the view stays render-only.
  - `render-pressable.ts` exports `shouldSuppressPress`/`shouldClaimResponder`/`isTerminationAllowed`, now shared by the Angular Pressable adapter - this resolves one real divergence, aligning Angular's `cancelable === undefined` handling with the other adapters' native-default behavior instead of its old hardcoded `cancelable !== false`.

- 6010442: Move `@symbiote-native/engine` from `dependencies` to `peerDependencies` (`>=0.1.0`) in every adapter and every package that imports engine internals, matching the existing `react`/`react-native` singleton-peer treatment. Engine holds module-scope singleton state — the node-identity `BRAND` symbol `isSymbioteNode`/`createElement` share, and the WeakMap-based commit mirror — that MUST be the same module instance everywhere it's touched. As a regular `dependencies` entry, each package independently resolved (and, once published via pkg.pr.new at a different point in the same session, independently pinned) its own copy of engine; inside a standalone `npm install` outside the pnpm workspace (`examples/*`), npm cannot dedupe distinct commit-pinned canary URLs, so multiple copies of engine landed side by side in `node_modules`, each with its own `BRAND` symbol.

  This surfaced as Angular's `HeaderOptionsScreen` search-bar buttons (`focus`/`setText`/`clearText`/`cancelSearch`) silently no-op'ing: `SearchBarRefDirective` reads the native node via `ElementRef.nativeElement` (created by `@symbiote-native/angular`'s own copy of `createElement`) and checks it with `@symbiote-native/navigation`'s own copy of `isSymbioteNode` — a genuine cross-package identity check that only Angular's ref-attachment shape happens to make (React/Vue's search-bar ref is a callback-prop resolved inside the SAME `createElement` call, so it never crosses a package boundary). `isSymbioteNode` returned `false` despite the object being a real, correctly-shaped native node — a different engine module's `BRAND` symbol, not a missing one — so the ref's `.current` stayed `null` forever, silently.

  Root-caused live via `mobile-mcp` device interaction (native search-bar tap fired `onFocus` correctly; imperative ref-driven buttons did not) plus a throwaway diagnostic patch of the installed `node_modules` copy dumping `Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(node).length` — confirmed exactly one (foreign) symbol present, not zero. `@symbiote-native/engine` now resolves to one singleton instance per consuming app, the same way `react`/`react-native` already do.

- 56ef0d9: Add the missing `"license": "MIT"` field to every publishable package's `package.json`. The
  `LICENSE` file itself was already shipping correctly (pnpm copies the workspace root `LICENSE`
  into a package's tarball at pack/publish time when the package has none of its own — confirmed
  against the already-published `@symbiote-native/slider@4.0.0` tarball on npm), but the
  `package.json` metadata field npm reads for the registry page's license badge and `npm install`'s
  own license check was missing on all eleven packages.

## 0.2.3

### Patch Changes

- 706e52f: Fix `scripts/fix-esm-extensions.mjs` baking a literal `/index.js` extension folder-as-module directory imports (`component-names/`, `share/`, `alert/`, `platform/`, `status-bar/`, `accessibility-info/`, `linking/`, ...) that also carry `index.ios.js`/`index.android.js` siblings. Once the specifier is explicit, Metro's platform-extension layering never runs, so every platform silently resolved to the same (iOS-hardcoded, headless-fallback) file — on Android this surfaced as `Can't find ViewManager 'PullToRefreshView' nor 'RCTPullToRefreshView'` and similar wrong-native-name crashes. The script now detects platform-specific siblings and leaves those specifiers extensionless, matching react-native-builder-bob's own accepted approach for the same tension (Node ESM needs explicit extensions; Metro needs them omitted to layer `.ios`/`.android`/`.native`). Known tradeoff, same as bob: a plain headless Node/ESM import reaching one of these folders directly (bypassing Metro) will fail to resolve — nothing in this repo currently does that.
- Updated dependencies [706e52f]
  - @symbiote-native/engine@0.1.4

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- 46a4f27: Documentation and code-comment cleanup: remove internal-only references and tighten wording. No runtime or API changes.
- Updated dependencies [46a4f27]
  - @symbiote-native/engine@0.1.3

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- c66082c: Fix relative imports missing file extensions in the published `build/` output, which broke every published package for real Node ESM consumers (Vitest, plain `node`, non-Metro bundlers) — `import('@symbiote-native/vue')` failed outright with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`. Metro's own resolver is lenient about missing extensions, which is why this went unnoticed until a published package's compiled output was consumed directly through Node's native ESM loader for the first time.

  The fix runs as a post-build step (`scripts/fix-esm-extensions.mjs`, wired into the root `build` script right after `typecheck`) that rewrites relative import specifiers in the already-compiled `build/**/*.js` files. It does not touch `src/*.ts` — Metro's resolver treats an explicit extension as literal (it only layers `.ios`/`.android`/`.native` suffixes on top, unlike `tsc`/Node's `.js`-maps-to-`.ts` resolution), so adding `.js` extensions directly in the TypeScript source breaks Metro's dev-mode resolution of the unbuilt source. Confirmed by reverting an earlier source-level attempt after it broke the local Vue example apps' bundling.

- Updated dependencies [c66082c]
  - @symbiote-native/engine@0.1.2

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- ab42ee8: Add a zero-config host bootstrap (`bootstrapHost` in `@symbiote-native/components`, plus `registerApp` / `createApp` / `bootstrapApplication` per adapter) that wires the native-host seams and AppRegistry in one call, collapsing the manual per-app wiring every canary previously repeated.
