# @symbiote-native/android

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- [`99fdbbb`](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/commit/99fdbbb54b72d5d06cfd95fbf0d82f2d9fe17a6a) Thanks [@OneEyed1366](https://github.com/OneEyed1366)! - Force a clean republish of every publishable package. `engine@1.3.0`/`components@3.1.1` proved a
  missing changeset on a producer package can leave its published tarball silently behind its own
  source (see the `symbiote-release-publishing` skill's changeset-skips-callee gap) with no CI
  signal. A blanket patch here is the cheap way to rule out the same gap sitting anywhere else:
  every package rebuilds and republishes from current HEAD, and `updateInternalDependencies: patch`
  bumps every internal `workspace:*`/`workspace:^` pin along with it.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- [`255c37f`](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/commit/255c37fd02fea1fc0b5e8a1410fc6834b1a3c8d1) Thanks [@OneEyed1366](https://github.com/OneEyed1366)! - Declare npm `keywords` and refresh the README of every companion package. Registry metadata only —
  no runtime change.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 3acd869: Add Solid.js as a supported framework: a new `@symbiote-native/solid` adapter reaching full
  component/runtime parity with the other four adapters, plus a `./solid` export subpath on every
  companion package. Engine and shared-component packages gained portal/tunnel, retained-tree
  census, and profiling infrastructure that the new adapter (and the others' portal/tunnel work
  landing alongside it) build on.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 56ef0d9: Add the missing `"license": "MIT"` field to every publishable package's `package.json`. The
  `LICENSE` file itself was already shipping correctly (pnpm copies the workspace root `LICENSE`
  into a package's tarball at pack/publish time when the package has none of its own — confirmed
  against the already-published `@symbiote-native/slider@4.0.0` tarball on npm), but the
  `package.json` metadata field npm reads for the registry page's license badge and `npm install`'s
  own license check was missing on all eleven packages.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Update package descriptions to the SymbioteNative brand name.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- First public release under the @symbiote-native npm scope.
