- [#86](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/pull/86) [`aa17531`](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/commit/aa175314db0f79474b9ac87bee3e30c4e87a72c4) Thanks [@OneEyed1366](https://github.com/OneEyed1366)! - README: the zero-config entry example was missing `import '@symbiote-native/svelte'` — the bare side-effect import that registers host behaviors (Pressable/Switch/Image); `/bootstrap` alone doesn't reach it, and Metro's production `inlineRequires` drops it silently without the bare import. Fixes the opening line and Parity section, both of which omitted Solid from the list of adapters sharing the core. Corrects the Node requirement (react-native 0.86 needs `>=22.13`, not `>=22.11`), documents the missing `collapseTextWhitespace` preprocessor, and leads Install with `npx @symbiote-native/cli new`.

Engine 1.2.0 and adapters 3.0.1 were already taken on npm, so the previous release skipped these packages.

  - Every adapter sends `isInvertedVirtualizedList` for inverted lists.
  - Svelte and Angular lists forward `removeClippedSubviews` and `nestedScrollEnabled` to their ScrollView. React, Vue and Solid list prop types now declare `nestedScrollEnabled`.
  - A bare boolean attribute (`<view accessible>`, `nested-scroll-enabled`) now reaches native as `true` in Vue templates and on Svelte tags. Before, it arrived as `""`, which Android rejects.

### Minor Changes

- [`d6fe117`](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/commit/d6fe117ea712a41e6118f0cb4e84799817ee8d21) Thanks [@OneEyed1366](https://github.com/OneEyed1366)! - Every item here is a place the press family answered differently from `react-native@0.86`, found by
  reading its source.

  Two controls fired backwards. `Switch` called `onValueChange` before `onChange` (`Switch.js:201-207`),
  `TextInput` called `onChangeText` before `onChange` (`TextInput.js:504-506`). Vendor fires the event
  handler first, so an app reading `event.nativeEvent` to accept or reject a value saw it after the
  value had been announced. `_onSelectionChange` had the same inversion (`:522-533`).

  `disabled` was only ever the raw prop. All three touchables resolve `disabled ?? aria-disabled ??
accessibilityState.disabled` before configuring Pressability (`TouchableOpacity.js:186` and siblings;
  Highlight has no `aria` leg, an upstream inconsistency matched rather than fixed). A control disabled
  through `accessibilityState` alone greyed out and kept firing `onPress`.

  The long-press timer is armed at `RESPONDER_GRANT`, so its threshold from touch-down is a flat 500 ms
  instead of 500 ms after press-in settles (`Pressability.js:471-478`). Movement is gated by a separate
  10 px jitter threshold, checked before the retention region (`:502-508`).

  `blockNativeResponder` is new across the family. `onResponderGrant` returns it (`Pressability.js:479`)
  to tell native to stand down, so a parent `ScrollView` cannot steal a claimed gesture mid-drag. We sent
  the default and yielded.

  `touchSoundDisabled` is new too, reaching Pressability as `android_disableSound`. It gates the Android
  release-time `SoundManager.playTouchSound()` (`:749-757`), a call that did not exist here - hence the
  new `SoundManager` engine module.

  `Pressable`'s bare tag commits `collapsable: false` unconditionally (`Pressable.js:340`). `Switch`
  claims the responder on both platforms (`:238-239,288-289`) and builds `accessibilityState` only once
  `disabled` resolves to something (`:235-238`). Both are tag rules in `SymbioteFabricProps.cpp`; the
  adapters gained prop declarations and nothing else.

### Patch Changes

- [`d6fe117`](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/commit/d6fe117ea712a41e6118f0cb4e84799817ee8d21) Thanks [@OneEyed1366](https://github.com/OneEyed1366)! - `DEFAULT_END_REACHED_THRESHOLD`, `DEFAULT_START_REACHED_THRESHOLD` and `visiblePercent` are gone from
  `@symbiote-native/components`. The first two were one RN default standing in for another, replaced by
  `DEFAULT_EDGE_REACHED_THRESHOLD_PX`; the third split in two and neither half is the old function.

  `onEndReached` fired two screens early. RN has two defaults here and we conflated them:
  `onEndReachedThresholdOrDefault`'s `?? 2` is a multiple of the visible length, used for render-ahead
  windowing, while the unset-case fallback deciding whether to actually FIRE is a flat 2 pixels
  (`VirtualizedList.js:1567`). An app passing no threshold gets the pixel answer now.

  Viewability precedence was inverted. `itemVisiblePercentThreshold` is a fraction of the CELL,
  `viewAreaCoveragePercentThreshold` a fraction of the VIEWPORT, so a short cell fully on screen clears
  the first easily and can fail the second. Vendor checks the area config first (`ViewabilityHelper.js`);
  we checked the item config. Its `_isEntirelyVisible` shortcut comes along, and a callback shared across
  several `viewabilityConfigCallbackPairs` is now told which config fired.

  Both `keyExtractor` defaults were wrong: the flat one is `item.key ?? item.id ?? String(index)`
  (`VirtualizeUtils.js:248`), and a section's own extractor beats the list-level one
  (`VirtualizedSectionList.js:305`).

  `RefreshControl` sends `setNativeRefreshing` only when `refreshing` did not change under it
  (`:139-158`) - the case that exists to stop the spinner drifting out of sync with the app.

  `Animated.parallel` crashed on a falsy array entry, the shape `cond && timing(...)` produces; vendor
  treats it as already finished (`AnimatedImplementation.js`'s `parallelImpl`). An `AnimatedValueXY` used
  straight as an `event()` mapping target worked only because the generic object walk happened to reach
  `x` and `y` - deliberate now, with a test.

- [`d6fe117`](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/commit/d6fe117ea712a41e6118f0cb4e84799817ee8d21) Thanks [@OneEyed1366](https://github.com/OneEyed1366)! - The same vendor read, applied to the view primitives.

  `InputAccessoryView` renders `null` on Android. We committed a real, laid-out `RCTView` and its whole
  subtree there. `VOID_COMPONENT` is the engine primitive for it: where `ANCHOR_COMPONENT` hoists its
  children up in its place, a void node contributes neither itself nor them.

  `Image` gets three vendor rules back. `defaultSource` resolves through `resolveAssetSource` like every
  other source slot (`ImageViewNativeComponent.js:138`), `alt` sets `accessible` unconditionally
  (`Image.android.js:272-273`), and the four load events stay silent on Android until
  `shouldNotifyLoadEvents` is on - vendor raises it whenever any one of them is authored, which is what
  `IMAGE_LOAD_EVENT_NAMES` answers.

  `ImageBackground` carries `importantForAccessibility` down to both of its nodes; vendor destructures it
  out of the spread and reapplies it explicitly (`:67,76,82`).

  `Modal` pinned its container to the left edge always - vendor picks the edge off `I18nManager.isRTL`
  (`Modal.js:372`). `ActivityIndicator` never sent Android `styleAttr` and `indeterminate` (`:100-103`),
  so the spinner took whatever the ViewManager defaulted to. `KeyboardAvoidingView` uses vendor's own
  duration formula, floor included (`:169-179`).

  `TouchableWithoutFeedback` needs `nativeID` to beat `id`, the reverse of every other tag.
  `IHostBehavior.nativeIdWinsOverId` says so once at `createElement` instead of each writer guessing.

  after a `cloneNode`), instead of spreading it on every individual `setAttribute`/`set_style`/
  `set_class`/`addEventListener` call. A copy-on-write ownership flag tracks whether an element is
  still the sole holder of its door bag; once it is, a write mutates in place and routes just the one
  changed key instead of re-diffing the whole bag — `foldedBag()` hands the bag back by reference when
  there is no `p` bag to merge, so a mutated-in-place write and a full diff would otherwise compare the
  bag against itself.

### Major Changes

- [#72](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/pull/72) [`022b9fd`](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/commit/022b9fdcc39640e6b99ddc9068242d9ac41bbd5f) Thanks [@OneEyed1366](https://github.com/OneEyed1366)! - `ActivityIndicator`, `Image`, `ImageBackground`, `RefreshControl`, `TouchableOpacity`,
  `TouchableHighlight`, `TouchableWithoutFeedback`, `TouchableNativeFeedback`, `Button` and
  `ScrollView` are no longer exported as components from `@symbiote-native/svelte`.

  Every one is now the intrinsic tag Svelte's preprocessor lowers at compile time
  (`<symbiote-view>` underneath `<view>`, and so on) — there is nothing left to import. `Image` and
  `TouchableNativeFeedback` survive as RN's static namespaces (`Image.getSize`,
  `TouchableNativeFeedback.Ripple`), moved to the module block since neither carries a view.
  `KeyboardAvoidingView`, `Modal`, `VirtualizedList`, `FlatList` and `VirtualizedSectionList` are
  unaffected. `Animated`'s component aliases go with them — there is no `Animated.View` /
  `Animated.Text` / `Animated.Image` any more; an animated value resolves in any prop of the plain
  tag directly (`<view style={{ opacity: someAnimatedValue }}>`), only `FlatList`/`SectionList`
  still need the `Animated.*` alias form.

  Migration: replace `import { Button } from '@symbiote-native/svelte'` + `<Button .../>` with
  `<button .../>` — props are unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- [#72](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/pull/72) [`022b9fd`](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/commit/022b9fdcc39640e6b99ddc9068242d9ac41bbd5f) Thanks [@OneEyed1366](https://github.com/OneEyed1366)! - A claimed child can now become the owner's PARENT, which is what an Android RefreshControl is.

  An Android ScrollView holds exactly one child, so a sibling refresh control is an `addViewAt`
  crash — RN inverts the tree there instead of beside-placing like it does on iOS. `claimedChildren`
  carries a mode per name, `beside` or `wrap`, and `ISymbioteNode.wrapper` records the inversion. The
  adapter goes on naming the scroll view for every insert, prop write and command; only the two
  structural entry points know a wrapper is what the tree holds.

  `IHostBehavior.onWrapChange` is where a behavior answers for it. The wrapper is the app's own node,
  so nothing could have given it a payload fold at creation — this is where the scroll view's layout
  style moves up to it and its visual style stays below.

  `splitScrollViewStyle` composes the axis base onto BOTH boxes, as RN does. All five adapters had
  dropped it from the wrapper, so an `AndroidSwipeRefreshLayout` with no explicit user layout style
  lost `flexGrow: 1` and collapsed to its content height inside a flex parent.

  `insertBefore`'s `beforeChild` is typed nullable, which is what its callers always passed.

### Minor Changes

- [`255c37f`](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/commit/255c37fd02fea1fc0b5e8a1410fc6834b1a3c8d1) Thanks [@OneEyed1366](https://github.com/OneEyed1366)! - Host primitives compile to intrinsic tags instead of framework components.

  `View`, `Text`, `Image`, `SafeAreaView`, `InputAccessoryView`, `Switch`, `TextInput` and
  `Pressable` are lowered at build time on Vue, Svelte, Solid and Angular, so a screen no longer
  allocates a component instance, a props proxy, an anchor node or an LView per primitive. The
  import and the call site are unchanged — which primitive is internally a tag is invisible to an
  app.

  What moved down with them:

  - The state each primitive needs is an engine host behavior keyed on its tag, not a framework
    lifecycle. Press, switch, text-input, image and input-accessory-view all register one.
  - The prop folds a wrapper used to perform run on the payload instead — `id` to `nativeID`,
    `Text`'s `ellipsizeMode`/`allowFontScaling` defaults, `TextInput`'s `inputMode`/`readOnly`/
    `enterKeyHint`, `Pressable`'s `disabled` accessibility state and its Android ripple. A lowered
    element commits the same payload as its wrapper; `core/test-utils`' equivalence oracle asserts
    it per primitive.
  - The `aria-*`/`role` fold resolves in the engine, so it reaches every path rather than the
    fourteen component bodies that used to carry it.
  - A functional `style={({pressed}) => …}` is specialised into a resting/active pair at build time,
    so the idiom the ecosystem writes lowers as authored. A CSS `:active` rule is not required.

  A transform refuses where lowering would change what an app can observe: a spread on a stateful
  primitive, a render-prop child, an instance-bound directive, a runtime value choosing the
  intrinsic. All five transforms answer one shared fixture table, so a divergence is a failing row
  rather than a device-only surprise.

  React keeps its wrappers — it has no build-time analysis, and host and composite are both fibers —
  and exports the same names.

  Measured on an iOS 26.5 simulator, Release, 1 000 rows of 10 native views, against stock React
  Native 0.86 on React's own Fabric renderer: Solid is under stock on all eight benchmark rows,
  Svelte and Vue on six of eight. Create is 0.76x/0.80x/0.89x and Append 0.49x/0.54x/0.55x for
  Solid/Svelte/Vue.

### Minor Changes

- 3acd869: Add Solid.js as a supported framework: a new `@symbiote-native/solid` adapter reaching full
  component/runtime parity with the other four adapters, plus a `./solid` export subpath on every
  companion package. Engine and shared-component packages gained portal/tunnel, retained-tree
  census, and profiling infrastructure that the new adapter (and the others' portal/tunnel work
  landing alongside it) build on.

### Patch Changes

- 0544cfb: Fix a sentence wrapped across source lines inside a `<Text>` rendering with a forced line break
  and stray leading spaces on device. Unlike Vue's template compiler, Svelte does not collapse
  whitespace inside a text node, so the literal newline and indentation reached the native text
  content unchanged. A new build-time preprocessor (`collapseTextWhitespace`, wired into both
  `svelte.config.js` and the Metro transformer) now collapses whitespace inside Text nodes the way a
  browser or Vue would, and deletes a whitespace-only text node stranded between siblings.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 388c353: Correct `Modal`'s `onOrientationChange` signature, which promised a payload it never delivered. The
  engine registers every `onX` listener as `(event: ISymbioteEvent) => handler(event)`, so a handler
  always receives the full wrapper. `onShow` / `onRequestClose` / `onDismiss` never noticed because
  they declare no argument, but `onOrientationChange` was typed against the unwrapped payload - a
  caller following the type read `event.orientation` and got `undefined` forever, while the value sat
  at `event.nativeEvent.orientation`.

  The handler is now typed `(event: ISymbioteEvent) => void` on every adapter, matching every other
  payload-carrying event in the codebase (`onLayout`, `onAccessibilityAction`, the press and scroll
  handlers), each of which narrows at the read site. `IModalOrientationChangeEvent` stays exported and
  is now documented as what it truthfully describes: the `nativeEvent` payload shape, not the handler
  argument.

  Code reading `event.orientation` will now fail to compile rather than silently receive `undefined`.
  Read `event.nativeEvent.orientation` instead.

  Angular additionally stops normalizing the event into `{ orientation }` - a divergence from the
  other three adapters that also swallowed the event entirely when the payload was not one of the two
  values it recognized.

### Patch Changes

- 388c353: Four unrelated defects, each small and each previously invisible in tests.

  **`keep-awake` leaked a listener across teardown.** Activation is async and nothing guarded the
  window: a consumer that unmounted before it resolved still got a listener registered afterwards,
  attached to something gone, with nothing left to remove it. React was half-clean - it had the
  unmount guard but discarded the subscription, so a listener attached during a NORMAL mount was
  never removed either. A shared attachment helper now refuses to attach after release and removes
  anything that already landed; all four adapters use it.

  **`clipboard.hasStringAsync` threw synchronously** where its eight siblings reject. It was declared
  `function`, not `async`, so the `UnavailabilityError` escaped at the call site before a promise
  existed - `hasStringAsync().catch(handler)` never reached the handler. (Upstream expo has the same
  split at `Clipboard.ts:57`; diverging here because a guard that fires differently from every other
  method in one API is a trap, not a wart.)

  **`AnimatedValue.resetAnimation` reset only the JS side.** The native graph keeps its own copy of
  the value, so a native-driven node stayed wherever the animation stopped while JS believed it had
  been reset - visible on device, invisible to every JS-driven test. `setValue` already pushed for
  this reason; RN pushes here too.

  **Vue's `setElementText` built an invalid Fabric tree in silence.** `insert()` throws when a raw
  text lands under a non-`<Text>` parent, but Vue routes an element's single string child through
  `setElementText`, which had no such check - so the same invalid tree the array path rejects was
  accepted quietly. It now enforces the same invariant. Only reachable from a hand-written `h()` on a
  raw intrinsic; the `View` wrapper passes children as slots and already hit the guard.

  **Svelte's web-only-construct guard missed namespace imports.** It inspected named import
  specifiers, which a namespace import has none of, so `import * as R from 'svelte/reactivity'`
  carried the banned `MediaQuery` straight through - a browser-only API that answers `false` to every
  query on a native host, indistinguishable from a legitimate no. A namespace import of a module with
  banned members is now refused, since the preprocessor cannot tell statically which members it
  reaches.

- 388c353: Make a partial `:global(...)` work inside a larger selector. `:global()` is the escape hatch for
  reaching markup a scoped style block does not own, and reaching into part of a descendant chain
  (`.card :global(.legacy-widget) span`) is its main use, not an edge case - but only a whole-selector
  wrapper was ever unwrapped. Anything else fell through the parser's guards and registered nothing.

  The wrapper is now erased wherever it sits, and its payload participates exactly as if written bare,
  following Svelte's per-part semantics rather than Vue's. Vue's `pluginScoped` replaces the WHOLE
  complex selector with the wrapper's contents, so `.card :global(.reset)` would collapse to a
  stylesheet-wide `.reset` and throw the `.card` half away - a scoped rule silently leaking globally,
  the opposite of what `<style scoped>` promises. One registry serves every adapter here, so the
  conservative reading wins.

  New export `globalClassTokensIn`, the token-level twin of the existing key-level
  `globalClassNamesIn`: it answers which MARKUP token stays unsuffixed, where the older function
  answers which registered key is global. Both the Vue SFC transformer and the Svelte scoped-style
  preprocessor consume it, so a token from a `:global()` payload is no longer scope-mangled while the
  rest of its selector is correctly scoped.

  `globalClassNamesIn` was rewritten to walk the parser's own tokenizer instead of matching text, and
  now returns a key only when every token in the selector came from a payload. Without that, a fully
  global COMPOUND selector (`:global(.btn.primary)`) would have regressed the moment token exemption
  landed: its key would have stayed suffixed while its tokens went exempt, leaving the rule dead. It
  also drops a false positive where `.reset { }` beside `.card :global(.reset) { }` unscoped the
  file's own rule.

  Fixes a latent tokenizer bug found alongside: a descendant chain link collected only its first
  class, so `.card .btn.primary` registered as `cardBtn` - a key no element carrying all three classes
  resolves to.

  The runtime half now meets the build-time one. Both halves of a partial `:global()` were correct on
  their own and still could not find each other: the two are suffixed by DIFFERENT rules - the
  registered key as a whole (`cardLegacy__<scope>`, because the rule still only applies where the
  file's own `.card` does), the markup token not at all (`legacy`, because that is what the escape
  hatch means). The engine's compound lookup rebuilds a scoped key by factoring the shared suffix out
  of the element's tokens, and it gave up the moment any token had none - which is every partial
  `:global()`, and every class handed down from a parent component. It now treats an unscoped token as
  contributing its own name and no scope, so the one scope present is still factorable. Two tokens
  carrying DIFFERENT suffixes still do not resolve: no rule legitimately spans two components.

  That widening is real and deliberate: a fully-scoped `.card.reset` collapses to the same key a
  `.card :global(.reset)` does, so an element carrying a foreign `reset` now matches a rule its author
  scoped to their own. The key format cannot tell the two apart - separating them needs a registry
  indexed by token set, with per-token scope, which is a larger change than this fix. Recorded in
  `scoped-conformance.test.ts` beside the behavior it comes with.

- 388c353: Move the AnimatedProps leaf lifecycle into the engine, where it should always have lived. Building
  a leaf from the current props, swapping it into the value graph new-before-old, binding it to the
  committed node, going native, rebinding native event props - none of that is framework-specific,
  and yet it was written four times, once per adapter. They drifted, which is the whole reason this
  is a changeset and not a refactor.

  Only the Svelte copy ever grew a rebuild guard, after a day of on-device debugging: without it,
  every scroll-driven passthrough tick tore down and reconnected a brand-new native node even though
  nothing animated-relevant had changed, and a reconnect landing exactly when scrolling stopped left
  the view frozen at its post-reset default. The other three copies each look like they have an
  equivalent and do not. React's `useMemo(() => new AnimatedProps(rest), [rest])` reads like the same
  reference check but never was one - `rest` comes out of a rest-destructure, so the dependency is a
  fresh object on every render. Vue's `pendingLeaf === null` answers "has render run yet", not "did
  anything change". Angular had nothing at all.

  New engine export `createAnimatedLeafLifecycle(label)`. All four adapters now drive it and supply
  only what is genuinely theirs: WHEN to reconcile (an effect, `onUpdated`, `ngOnChanges`, a
  `$effect`) and HOW to resolve the host node. Angular additionally keeps its `whenCommitted`
  deferral, which its batched zoneless change detection requires.

  The guard compares props per key by IDENTITY against a stored SNAPSHOT, never against the caller's
  own object. That distinction is load-bearing rather than defensive: a caller may legitimately hand
  back the same object every update and mutate what its keys resolve to (Svelte's rest proxy does
  exactly this), so storing the reference would compare it with itself, read the same current values
  through both sides, and conclude nothing ever changes. The rebuild would then be skipped forever
  and a rebuilt interpolation would never reach the native graph - on device, a sticky header that
  ignores scrolling entirely.

  It is also gated on the leaf already being native, and that gate points the other way: before the
  first native connection reconcile must run on every call, because that cadence is what wires a
  rebuilt interpolation into the shared value's children. Skipping there strands the new node, its
  listener never fires, and the debounce that would have promoted the chain to native never settles.

  Only the NATIVE half of a reconcile is deferrable, via an optional `scheduleNativeBind` callback -
  Angular passes `bind => whenCommitted(node, bind)` because its batched zoneless change detection has
  no committed Fabric tag at `ngAfterViewInit`. Building the leaf and attaching it to the value graph
  is always synchronous, and that split is load-bearing rather than tidy: a deferred build sits behind
  a canceller the next reconcile drops, so a component reconciling faster than it commits attaches
  nothing at all and a sticky header's rebuilt interpolation never reaches the graph.

  Behavior is unchanged for React, Vue and Svelte beyond the guard the first two never had. No public
  component API moves.
