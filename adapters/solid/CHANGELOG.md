### Patch Changes

- [`1e8cd62`](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/commit/1e8cd62387caded852fbb8e14c04b3195fc2c516) Thanks [@OneEyed1366](https://github.com/OneEyed1366)! - Ship the Android parity release. Engine 1.2.0 and adapters 3.0.1 were already taken on npm, so the previous release skipped these packages.

### Patch Changes

- [`26775bc`](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/commit/26775bce65788f9074dcb10460f8cf683be5ed70) Thanks [@OneEyed1366](https://github.com/OneEyed1366)! - - Every adapter keeps an iOS Modal mounted until native dismiss, then calls `onDismiss`.
  - Every adapter sends `isInvertedVirtualizedList` for inverted lists.
  - Svelte and Angular lists forward `removeClippedSubviews` and `nestedScrollEnabled` to their ScrollView. React, Vue and Solid list prop types now declare `nestedScrollEnabled`.
  - A bare boolean attribute (`<view accessible>`, `nested-scroll-enabled`) now reaches native as `true` in Vue templates and on Svelte tags. Before, it arrived as `""`, which Android rejects.

### Minor Changes

- [`d6fe117`](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/commit/d6fe117ea712a41e6118f0cb4e84799817ee8d21) Thanks [@OneEyed1366](https://github.com/OneEyed1366)! - Every item here is a place the press family answered differently from `react-native@0.86`, found by
  reading its source.

  Two controls fired backwards. `Switch` called `onValueChange` before `onChange` (`Switch.js:201-207`),
  `TextInput` called `onChangeText` before `onChange` (`TextInput.js:504-506`). Vendor fires the event
  handler first, so an app reading `event.nativeEvent` to accept or reject a value saw it after the
  value had been announced. `_onSelectionChange` had the same inversion (`:522-533`).

  `disabled` was only ever the raw prop. All three touchables resolve `disabled ?? aria-disabled ??
accessibilityState.disabled` before configuring Pressability (`TouchableOpacity.js:186` and siblings;
  Highlight has no `aria` leg, an upstream inconsistency matched rather than fixed). A control disabled
  through `accessibilityState` alone greyed out and kept firing `onPress`.

  The long-press timer is armed at `RESPONDER_GRANT`, so its threshold from touch-down is a flat 500 ms
  instead of 500 ms after press-in settles (`Pressability.js:471-478`). Movement is gated by a separate
  10 px jitter threshold, checked before the retention region (`:502-508`).

  `blockNativeResponder` is new across the family. `onResponderGrant` returns it (`Pressability.js:479`)
  to tell native to stand down, so a parent `ScrollView` cannot steal a claimed gesture mid-drag. We sent
  the default and yielded.

  `touchSoundDisabled` is new too, reaching Pressability as `android_disableSound`. It gates the Android
  release-time `SoundManager.playTouchSound()` (`:749-757`), a call that did not exist here - hence the
  new `SoundManager` engine module.

  `Pressable`'s bare tag commits `collapsable: false` unconditionally (`Pressable.js:340`). `Switch`
  claims the responder on both platforms (`:238-239,288-289`) and builds `accessibilityState` only once
  `disabled` resolves to something (`:235-238`). Both are tag rules in `SymbioteFabricProps.cpp`; the
  adapters gained prop declarations and nothing else.

### Patch Changes

- [#78](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/pull/78) [`3d96ca3`](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/commit/3d96ca368a90504d6a9053f3937718aa0fe9a44a) Thanks [@OneEyed1366](https://github.com/OneEyed1366)! - Rewrite the README to match the other adapters' shape (Install/Use it/Parity/Run it/Test it) and state explicitly that Solid's surface is verified on-device, same as React/Vue/Svelte/Angular. Also fixes a stale claim that `metro.config.js` needs `unstable_conditionNames: ['browser']` — it deliberately doesn't, and setting it would break the `react-native` resolution condition.

- [`d6fe117`](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/commit/d6fe117ea712a41e6118f0cb4e84799817ee8d21) Thanks [@OneEyed1366](https://github.com/OneEyed1366)! - `DEFAULT_END_REACHED_THRESHOLD`, `DEFAULT_START_REACHED_THRESHOLD` and `visiblePercent` are gone from
  `@symbiote-native/components`. The first two were one RN default standing in for another, replaced by
  `DEFAULT_EDGE_REACHED_THRESHOLD_PX`; the third split in two and neither half is the old function.

  `onEndReached` fired two screens early. RN has two defaults here and we conflated them:
  `onEndReachedThresholdOrDefault`'s `?? 2` is a multiple of the visible length, used for render-ahead
  windowing, while the unset-case fallback deciding whether to actually FIRE is a flat 2 pixels
  (`VirtualizedList.js:1567`). An app passing no threshold gets the pixel answer now.

  Viewability precedence was inverted. `itemVisiblePercentThreshold` is a fraction of the CELL,
  `viewAreaCoveragePercentThreshold` a fraction of the VIEWPORT, so a short cell fully on screen clears
  the first easily and can fail the second. Vendor checks the area config first (`ViewabilityHelper.js`);
  we checked the item config. Its `_isEntirelyVisible` shortcut comes along, and a callback shared across
  several `viewabilityConfigCallbackPairs` is now told which config fired.

  Both `keyExtractor` defaults were wrong: the flat one is `item.key ?? item.id ?? String(index)`
  (`VirtualizeUtils.js:248`), and a section's own extractor beats the list-level one
  (`VirtualizedSectionList.js:305`).

  `RefreshControl` sends `setNativeRefreshing` only when `refreshing` did not change under it
  (`:139-158`) - the case that exists to stop the spinner drifting out of sync with the app.

  `Animated.parallel` crashed on a falsy array entry, the shape `cond && timing(...)` produces; vendor
  treats it as already finished (`AnimatedImplementation.js`'s `parallelImpl`). An `AnimatedValueXY` used
  straight as an `event()` mapping target worked only because the generic object walk happened to reach
  `x` and `y` - deliberate now, with a test.

- [`d6fe117`](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/commit/d6fe117ea712a41e6118f0cb4e84799817ee8d21) Thanks [@OneEyed1366](https://github.com/OneEyed1366)! - The same vendor read, applied to the view primitives.

  `InputAccessoryView` renders `null` on Android. We committed a real, laid-out `RCTView` and its whole
  subtree there. `VOID_COMPONENT` is the engine primitive for it: where `ANCHOR_COMPONENT` hoists its
  children up in its place, a void node contributes neither itself nor them.

  `Image` gets three vendor rules back. `defaultSource` resolves through `resolveAssetSource` like every
  other source slot (`ImageViewNativeComponent.js:138`), `alt` sets `accessible` unconditionally
  (`Image.android.js:272-273`), and the four load events stay silent on Android until
  `shouldNotifyLoadEvents` is on - vendor raises it whenever any one of them is authored, which is what
  `IMAGE_LOAD_EVENT_NAMES` answers.

  `ImageBackground` carries `importantForAccessibility` down to both of its nodes; vendor destructures it
  out of the spread and reapplies it explicitly (`:67,76,82`).

  `Modal` pinned its container to the left edge always - vendor picks the edge off `I18nManager.isRTL`
  (`Modal.js:372`). `ActivityIndicator` never sent Android `styleAttr` and `indeterminate` (`:100-103`),
  so the spinner took whatever the ViewManager defaulted to. `KeyboardAvoidingView` uses vendor's own
  duration formula, floor included (`:169-179`).

  `TouchableWithoutFeedback` needs `nativeID` to beat `id`, the reverse of every other tag.
  `IHostBehavior.nativeIdWinsOverId` says so once at `createElement` instead of each writer guessing.

### Major Changes

- [#72](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/pull/72) [`022b9fd`](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/commit/022b9fdcc39640e6b99ddc9068242d9ac41bbd5f) Thanks [@OneEyed1366](https://github.com/OneEyed1366)! - `Button` and `ImageBackground` are no longer exported as components from `@symbiote-native/solid`,
  and the `<scroll-view>` tag drops the last wrapper still standing behind it.

  `Animated.View`, `Animated.Text` and `Animated.Image` are also gone — there is no dotted alias for a
  primitive that is already a tag; an animated value resolves in any prop of the plain element
  directly (`<view style={{ opacity: someAnimatedValue }}>`, `.claude/rules/animated-values-resolve-in-the-engine.md`).
  Only `Animated.ScrollView`, `Animated.FlatList` and `Animated.SectionList` remain, for the three
  primitives still genuinely components.

  Migration: replace `import { Button } from '@symbiote-native/solid'` + `<Button .../>` with
  `<button .../>`, and `<Animated.View style={...}/>` with `<view style={...}/>` — props are
  unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- [#72](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/pull/72) [`022b9fd`](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/commit/022b9fdcc39640e6b99ddc9068242d9ac41bbd5f) Thanks [@OneEyed1366](https://github.com/OneEyed1366)! - A claimed child can now become the owner's PARENT, which is what an Android RefreshControl is.

  An Android ScrollView holds exactly one child, so a sibling refresh control is an `addViewAt`
  crash — RN inverts the tree there instead of beside-placing like it does on iOS. `claimedChildren`
  carries a mode per name, `beside` or `wrap`, and `ISymbioteNode.wrapper` records the inversion. The
  adapter goes on naming the scroll view for every insert, prop write and command; only the two
  structural entry points know a wrapper is what the tree holds.

  `IHostBehavior.onWrapChange` is where a behavior answers for it. The wrapper is the app's own node,
  so nothing could have given it a payload fold at creation — this is where the scroll view's layout
  style moves up to it and its visual style stays below.

  `splitScrollViewStyle` composes the axis base onto BOTH boxes, as RN does. All five adapters had
  dropped it from the wrapper, so an `AndroidSwipeRefreshLayout` with no explicit user layout style
  lost `flexGrow: 1` and collapsed to its content height inside a flex parent.

  `insertBefore`'s `beforeChild` is typed nullable, which is what its callers always passed.

- [#72](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/pull/72) [`022b9fd`](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/commit/022b9fdcc39640e6b99ddc9068242d9ac41bbd5f) Thanks [@OneEyed1366](https://github.com/OneEyed1366)! - Fix `<scroll-view>` losing content children when one is removed: Solid's renderer walked the tag's
  own node to find where a removed child had been, but a composed primitive's app-facing children
  live under its internal slot (`ISymbioteNode.childHost`), not the owner directly. Removing a child
  resolved the wrong parent and orphaned it instead of detaching it from the tree.

- [#72](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/pull/72) [`022b9fd`](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/commit/022b9fdcc39640e6b99ddc9068242d9ac41bbd5f) Thanks [@OneEyed1366](https://github.com/OneEyed1366)! - `@symbiote-native/vue` gains its own `jsx-runtime` module (for `jsxImportSource:
'@symbiote-native/vue'` in Vue-TSX apps), built on the new `ICrossTypedIntrinsics` shape: every
  intrinsic tag types as a loose attribute bag except the ones with a real prop type
  (`IPressableProps`, `IRefreshControlProps`, …), which type-check for real instead of accepting
  anything. `intrinsic-elements.ts` and the `.vue` SFC `GlobalComponents`/Volar table move onto the
  same generic, so a template and a TSX file no longer disagree on what a tag accepts.

  `@symbiote-native/solid`'s existing `jsx-runtime.ts` (it reached this shape first) extends onto the
  same shared generic rather than its own hand-rolled version.

### Minor Changes

- [`255c37f`](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/commit/255c37fd02fea1fc0b5e8a1410fc6834b1a3c8d1) Thanks [@OneEyed1366](https://github.com/OneEyed1366)! - Host primitives compile to intrinsic tags instead of framework components.

  `View`, `Text`, `Image`, `SafeAreaView`, `InputAccessoryView`, `Switch`, `TextInput` and
  `Pressable` are lowered at build time on Vue, Svelte, Solid and Angular, so a screen no longer
  allocates a component instance, a props proxy, an anchor node or an LView per primitive. The
  import and the call site are unchanged — which primitive is internally a tag is invisible to an
  app.

  What moved down with them:

  - The state each primitive needs is an engine host behavior keyed on its tag, not a framework
    lifecycle. Press, switch, text-input, image and input-accessory-view all register one.
  - The prop folds a wrapper used to perform run on the payload instead — `id` to `nativeID`,
    `Text`'s `ellipsizeMode`/`allowFontScaling` defaults, `TextInput`'s `inputMode`/`readOnly`/
    `enterKeyHint`, `Pressable`'s `disabled` accessibility state and its Android ripple. A lowered
    element commits the same payload as its wrapper; `core/test-utils`' equivalence oracle asserts
    it per primitive.
  - The `aria-*`/`role` fold resolves in the engine, so it reaches every path rather than the
    fourteen component bodies that used to carry it.
  - A functional `style={({pressed}) => …}` is specialised into a resting/active pair at build time,
    so the idiom the ecosystem writes lowers as authored. A CSS `:active` rule is not required.

  A transform refuses where lowering would change what an app can observe: a spread on a stateful
  primitive, a render-prop child, an instance-bound directive, a runtime value choosing the
  intrinsic. All five transforms answer one shared fixture table, so a divergence is a failing row
  rather than a device-only surprise.

  React keeps its wrappers — it has no build-time analysis, and host and composite are both fibers —
  and exports the same names.

  Measured on an iOS 26.5 simulator, Release, 1 000 rows of 10 native views, against stock React
  Native 0.86 on React's own Fabric renderer: Solid is under stock on all eight benchmark rows,
  Svelte and Vue on six of eight. Create is 0.76x/0.80x/0.89x and Append 0.49x/0.54x/0.55x for
  Solid/Svelte/Vue.

  component/runtime parity with the other four adapters, plus a `./solid` export subpath on every
  companion package. Engine and shared-component packages gained portal/tunnel, retained-tree
  census, and profiling infrastructure that the new adapter (and the others' portal/tunnel work
  landing alongside it) build on.
