# @symbiote-native/solid

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#72](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/pull/72) [`022b9fd`](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/commit/022b9fdcc39640e6b99ddc9068242d9ac41bbd5f) Thanks [@OneEyed1366](https://github.com/OneEyed1366)! - `Button` and `ImageBackground` are no longer exported as components from `@symbiote-native/solid`,
  and the `<scroll-view>` tag drops the last wrapper still standing behind it.

  `Animated.View`, `Animated.Text` and `Animated.Image` are also gone — there is no dotted alias for a
  primitive that is already a tag; an animated value resolves in any prop of the plain element
  directly (`<view style={{ opacity: someAnimatedValue }}>`, `.claude/rules/animated-values-resolve-in-the-engine.md`).
  Only `Animated.ScrollView`, `Animated.FlatList` and `Animated.SectionList` remain, for the three
  primitives still genuinely components.

  Migration: replace `import { Button } from '@symbiote-native/solid'` + `<Button .../>` with
  `<button .../>`, and `<Animated.View style={...}/>` with `<view style={...}/>` — props are
  unchanged.

### Patch Changes

  An Android ScrollView holds exactly one child, so a sibling refresh control is an `addViewAt`
  crash — RN inverts the tree there instead of beside-placing like it does on iOS. `claimedChildren`
  carries a mode per name, `beside` or `wrap`, and `ISymbioteNode.wrapper` records the inversion. The
  adapter goes on naming the scroll view for every insert, prop write and command; only the two
  structural entry points know a wrapper is what the tree holds.

  `IHostBehavior.onWrapChange` is where a behavior answers for it. The wrapper is the app's own node,
  so nothing could have given it a payload fold at creation — this is where the scroll view's layout
  style moves up to it and its visual style stays below.

  `splitScrollViewStyle` composes the axis base onto BOTH boxes, as RN does. All five adapters had
  dropped it from the wrapper, so an `AndroidSwipeRefreshLayout` with no explicit user layout style
  lost `flexGrow: 1` and collapsed to its content height inside a flex parent.

  `insertBefore`'s `beforeChild` is typed nullable, which is what its callers always passed.

  own node to find where a removed child had been, but a composed primitive's app-facing children
  live under its internal slot (`ISymbioteNode.childHost`), not the owner directly. Removing a child
  resolved the wrong parent and orphaned it instead of detaching it from the tree.

'@symbiote-native/vue'` in Vue-TSX apps), built on the new `ICrossTypedIntrinsics` shape: every
  intrinsic tag types as a loose attribute bag except the ones with a real prop type
  (`IPressableProps`, `IRefreshControlProps`, …), which type-check for real instead of accepting
  anything. `intrinsic-elements.ts` and the `.vue` SFC `GlobalComponents`/Volar table move onto the
  same generic, so a template and a TSX file no longer disagree on what a tag accepts.

  `@symbiote-native/solid`'s existing `jsx-runtime.ts` (it reached this shape first) extends onto the
  same shared generic rather than its own hand-rolled version.

### Minor Changes

- [`255c37f`](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/commit/255c37fd02fea1fc0b5e8a1410fc6834b1a3c8d1) Thanks [@OneEyed1366](https://github.com/OneEyed1366)! - Host primitives compile to intrinsic tags instead of framework components.

  `View`, `Text`, `Image`, `SafeAreaView`, `InputAccessoryView`, `Switch`, `TextInput` and
  `Pressable` are lowered at build time on Vue, Svelte, Solid and Angular, so a screen no longer
  allocates a component instance, a props proxy, an anchor node or an LView per primitive. The
  import and the call site are unchanged — which primitive is internally a tag is invisible to an
  app.

  What moved down with them:

  - The state each primitive needs is an engine host behavior keyed on its tag, not a framework
    lifecycle. Press, switch, text-input, image and input-accessory-view all register one.
  - The prop folds a wrapper used to perform run on the payload instead — `id` to `nativeID`,
    `Text`'s `ellipsizeMode`/`allowFontScaling` defaults, `TextInput`'s `inputMode`/`readOnly`/
    `enterKeyHint`, `Pressable`'s `disabled` accessibility state and its Android ripple. A lowered
    element commits the same payload as its wrapper; `core/test-utils`' equivalence oracle asserts
    it per primitive.
  - The `aria-*`/`role` fold resolves in the engine, so it reaches every path rather than the
    fourteen component bodies that used to carry it.
  - A functional `style={({pressed}) => …}` is specialised into a resting/active pair at build time,
    so the idiom the ecosystem writes lowers as authored. A CSS `:active` rule is not required.

  A transform refuses where lowering would change what an app can observe: a spread on a stateful
  primitive, a render-prop child, an instance-bound directive, a runtime value choosing the
  intrinsic. All five transforms answer one shared fixture table, so a divergence is a failing row
  rather than a device-only surprise.

  React keeps its wrappers — it has no build-time analysis, and host and composite are both fibers —
  and exports the same names.

  Measured on an iOS 26.5 simulator, Release, 1 000 rows of 10 native views, against stock React
  Native 0.86 on React's own Fabric renderer: Solid is under stock on all eight benchmark rows,
  Svelte and Vue on six of eight. Create is 0.76x/0.80x/0.89x and Append 0.49x/0.54x/0.55x for
  Solid/Svelte/Vue.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 3acd869: Add Solid.js as a supported framework: a new `@symbiote-native/solid` adapter reaching full
  component/runtime parity with the other four adapters, plus a `./solid` export subpath on every
  companion package. Engine and shared-component packages gained portal/tunnel, retained-tree
  census, and profiling infrastructure that the new adapter (and the others' portal/tunnel work
  landing alongside it) build on.
