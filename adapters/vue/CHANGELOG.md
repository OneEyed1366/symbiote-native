# @symbiote-native/vue

## 1.0.0

### Minor Changes

- [`255c37f`](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/commit/255c37fd02fea1fc0b5e8a1410fc6834b1a3c8d1) Thanks [@OneEyed1366](https://github.com/OneEyed1366)! - Host primitives compile to intrinsic tags instead of framework components.

  `View`, `Text`, `Image`, `SafeAreaView`, `InputAccessoryView`, `Switch`, `TextInput` and
  `Pressable` are lowered at build time on Vue, Svelte, Solid and Angular, so a screen no longer
  allocates a component instance, a props proxy, an anchor node or an LView per primitive. The
  import and the call site are unchanged — which primitive is internally a tag is invisible to an
  app.

  What moved down with them:

  - The state each primitive needs is an engine host behavior keyed on its tag, not a framework
    lifecycle. Press, switch, text-input, image and input-accessory-view all register one.
  - The prop folds a wrapper used to perform run on the payload instead — `id` to `nativeID`,
    `Text`'s `ellipsizeMode`/`allowFontScaling` defaults, `TextInput`'s `inputMode`/`readOnly`/
    `enterKeyHint`, `Pressable`'s `disabled` accessibility state and its Android ripple. A lowered
    element commits the same payload as its wrapper; `core/test-utils`' equivalence oracle asserts
    it per primitive.
  - The `aria-*`/`role` fold resolves in the engine, so it reaches every path rather than the
    fourteen component bodies that used to carry it.
  - A functional `style={({pressed}) => …}` is specialised into a resting/active pair at build time,
    so the idiom the ecosystem writes lowers as authored. A CSS `:active` rule is not required.

  A transform refuses where lowering would change what an app can observe: a spread on a stateful
  primitive, a render-prop child, an instance-bound directive, a runtime value choosing the
  intrinsic. All five transforms answer one shared fixture table, so a divergence is a failing row
  rather than a device-only surprise.

  React keeps its wrappers — it has no build-time analysis, and host and composite are both fibers —
  and exports the same names.

  Measured on an iOS 26.5 simulator, Release, 1 000 rows of 10 native views, against stock React
  Native 0.86 on React's own Fabric renderer: Solid is under stock on all eight benchmark rows,
  Svelte and Vue on six of eight. Create is 0.76x/0.80x/0.89x and Append 0.49x/0.54x/0.55x for
  Solid/Svelte/Vue.

- [`255c37f`](https://github.com/OneEyed1366/symbiote-native/commit/255c37fd02fea1fc0b5e8a1410fc6834b1a3c8d1) Thanks [@OneEyed1366](https://github.com/OneEyed1366)! - A lowered element retargets Vue's own template sugar, and three of those retargets destroyed a
  prop before any adapter code ran.

  `v-bind="bag"`, `mergeProps` and a bare `:style="fn"` each reach `@vue/shared`'s `normalizeStyle`,
  which returns `undefined` for a function — so a functional `style` inside a spread was gone before
  the engine could specialise it. The three helpers call `normalizeStyle` by module-internal
  reference, so one override cannot cover the others; all three are now shimmed in
  `runtime-helpers`, scoped to `style` and preserving a top-level callback only. An array containing
  a callback stays out of contract, matching RN's own `Pressable` types.

  `v-model` on a lowered element compiles to the `vModelText` runtime directive whatever the
  primitive is, because Vue picks the directive by element and every lowered tag looks the same to
  it. On `Switch` that stringified the value and the behavior read `String(true)` as off forever;
  the write now branches on the primitive.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 3acd869: Add Solid.js as a supported framework: a new `@symbiote-native/solid` adapter reaching full
  component/runtime parity with the other four adapters, plus a `./solid` export subpath on every
  companion package. Engine and shared-component packages gained portal/tunnel, retained-tree
  census, and profiling infrastructure that the new adapter (and the others' portal/tunnel work
  landing alongside it) build on.

  - @symbiote-native/css-parser@0.4.0

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 388c353: Close 22 gaps in the adapters' public barrels. About half of each adapter's surface is names
  re-exported verbatim from `@symbiote-native/engine` and `@symbiote-native/components`, and nothing
  enforced that the four lists agreed, so they drifted apart. A missing re-export is not a type
  error, so `tsc` never saw it — it only surfaced when an app tried to import a name and its
  framework's package turned out not to have it.

  Newly reachable per adapter: React gains `setColorProcessor`, `setDeviceEventSource`, `dlog`,
  `isDebug`, `ISymbioteNode`, `IRootTag`, `IKeyboardEvent`, `IKeyboardMetrics` and ten
  component-detail types; Vue gains `setDeviceEventSource` and five types; Angular gains eleven
  engine types and eleven component types. `ITextInputProps` stays deliberately per-adapter, since
  React and Vue declare their own over the shared agnostic base and Angular takes props as
  `@Input()`s.

  `tests/adapter-barrel-parity.test.ts` now enforces this and compares its known-gap list for
  equality, so adding a shared name to one barrel without the rest fails with the adapters named,
  and closing a gap without deleting its entry fails too — the list cannot rot into an allowlist.

  Also removes 31 passthrough stub files (`src/modules/x.ts` containing nothing but a re-export from
  the engine). They were internal, so no import path changes: a pure passthrough belongs in the
  barrel itself.

- 388c353: Correct `Modal`'s `onOrientationChange` signature, which promised a payload it never delivered. The
  engine registers every `onX` listener as `(event: ISymbioteEvent) => handler(event)`, so a handler
  always receives the full wrapper. `onShow` / `onRequestClose` / `onDismiss` never noticed because
  they declare no argument, but `onOrientationChange` was typed against the unwrapped payload - a
  caller following the type read `event.orientation` and got `undefined` forever, while the value sat
  at `event.nativeEvent.orientation`.

  The handler is now typed `(event: ISymbioteEvent) => void` on every adapter, matching every other
  payload-carrying event in the codebase (`onLayout`, `onAccessibilityAction`, the press and scroll
  handlers), each of which narrows at the read site. `IModalOrientationChangeEvent` stays exported and
  is now documented as what it truthfully describes: the `nativeEvent` payload shape, not the handler
  argument.

  Code reading `event.orientation` will now fail to compile rather than silently receive `undefined`.
  Read `event.nativeEvent.orientation` instead.

  Angular additionally stops normalizing the event into `{ orientation }` - a divergence from the
  other three adapters that also swallowed the event entirely when the payload was not one of the two
  values it recognized.

### Patch Changes

- 388c353: Four unrelated defects, each small and each previously invisible in tests.

  **`keep-awake` leaked a listener across teardown.** Activation is async and nothing guarded the
  window: a consumer that unmounted before it resolved still got a listener registered afterwards,
  attached to something gone, with nothing left to remove it. React was half-clean - it had the
  unmount guard but discarded the subscription, so a listener attached during a NORMAL mount was
  never removed either. A shared attachment helper now refuses to attach after release and removes
  anything that already landed; all four adapters use it.

  **`clipboard.hasStringAsync` threw synchronously** where its eight siblings reject. It was declared
  `function`, not `async`, so the `UnavailabilityError` escaped at the call site before a promise
  existed - `hasStringAsync().catch(handler)` never reached the handler. (Upstream expo has the same
  split at `Clipboard.ts:57`; diverging here because a guard that fires differently from every other
  method in one API is a trap, not a wart.)

  **`AnimatedValue.resetAnimation` reset only the JS side.** The native graph keeps its own copy of
  the value, so a native-driven node stayed wherever the animation stopped while JS believed it had
  been reset - visible on device, invisible to every JS-driven test. `setValue` already pushed for
  this reason; RN pushes here too.

  **Vue's `setElementText` built an invalid Fabric tree in silence.** `insert()` throws when a raw
  text lands under a non-`<Text>` parent, but Vue routes an element's single string child through
  `setElementText`, which had no such check - so the same invalid tree the array path rejects was
  accepted quietly. It now enforces the same invariant. Only reachable from a hand-written `h()` on a
  raw intrinsic; the `View` wrapper passes children as slots and already hit the guard.

  **Svelte's web-only-construct guard missed namespace imports.** It inspected named import
  specifiers, which a namespace import has none of, so `import * as R from 'svelte/reactivity'`
  carried the banned `MediaQuery` straight through - a browser-only API that answers `false` to every
  query on a native host, indistinguishable from a legitimate no. A namespace import of a module with
  banned members is now refused, since the preprocessor cannot tell statically which members it
  reaches.

- 388c353: Make a partial `:global(...)` work inside a larger selector. `:global()` is the escape hatch for
  reaching markup a scoped style block does not own, and reaching into part of a descendant chain
  (`.card :global(.legacy-widget) span`) is its main use, not an edge case - but only a whole-selector
  wrapper was ever unwrapped. Anything else fell through the parser's guards and registered nothing.

  The wrapper is now erased wherever it sits, and its payload participates exactly as if written bare,
  following Svelte's per-part semantics rather than Vue's. Vue's `pluginScoped` replaces the WHOLE
  complex selector with the wrapper's contents, so `.card :global(.reset)` would collapse to a
  stylesheet-wide `.reset` and throw the `.card` half away - a scoped rule silently leaking globally,
  the opposite of what `<style scoped>` promises. One registry serves every adapter here, so the
  conservative reading wins.

  New export `globalClassTokensIn`, the token-level twin of the existing key-level
  `globalClassNamesIn`: it answers which MARKUP token stays unsuffixed, where the older function
  answers which registered key is global. Both the Vue SFC transformer and the Svelte scoped-style
  preprocessor consume it, so a token from a `:global()` payload is no longer scope-mangled while the
  rest of its selector is correctly scoped.

  `globalClassNamesIn` was rewritten to walk the parser's own tokenizer instead of matching text, and
  now returns a key only when every token in the selector came from a payload. Without that, a fully
  global COMPOUND selector (`:global(.btn.primary)`) would have regressed the moment token exemption
  landed: its key would have stayed suffixed while its tokens went exempt, leaving the rule dead. It
  also drops a false positive where `.reset { }` beside `.card :global(.reset) { }` unscoped the
  file's own rule.

  Fixes a latent tokenizer bug found alongside: a descendant chain link collected only its first
  class, so `.card .btn.primary` registered as `cardBtn` - a key no element carrying all three classes
  resolves to.

  The runtime half now meets the build-time one. Both halves of a partial `:global()` were correct on
  their own and still could not find each other: the two are suffixed by DIFFERENT rules - the
  registered key as a whole (`cardLegacy__<scope>`, because the rule still only applies where the
  file's own `.card` does), the markup token not at all (`legacy`, because that is what the escape
  hatch means). The engine's compound lookup rebuilds a scoped key by factoring the shared suffix out
  of the element's tokens, and it gave up the moment any token had none - which is every partial
  `:global()`, and every class handed down from a parent component. It now treats an unscoped token as
  contributing its own name and no scope, so the one scope present is still factorable. Two tokens
  carrying DIFFERENT suffixes still do not resolve: no rule legitimately spans two components.

  That widening is real and deliberate: a fully-scoped `.card.reset` collapses to the same key a
  `.card :global(.reset)` does, so an element carrying a foreign `reset` now matches a rule its author
  scoped to their own. The key format cannot tell the two apart - separating them needs a registry
  indexed by token set, with per-token scope, which is a larger change than this fix. Recorded in
  `scoped-conformance.test.ts` beside the behavior it comes with.

- 388c353: Move the AnimatedProps leaf lifecycle into the engine, where it should always have lived. Building
  a leaf from the current props, swapping it into the value graph new-before-old, binding it to the
  committed node, going native, rebinding native event props - none of that is framework-specific,
  and yet it was written four times, once per adapter. They drifted, which is the whole reason this
  is a changeset and not a refactor.

  Only the Svelte copy ever grew a rebuild guard, after a day of on-device debugging: without it,
  every scroll-driven passthrough tick tore down and reconnected a brand-new native node even though
  nothing animated-relevant had changed, and a reconnect landing exactly when scrolling stopped left
  the view frozen at its post-reset default. The other three copies each look like they have an
  equivalent and do not. React's `useMemo(() => new AnimatedProps(rest), [rest])` reads like the same
  reference check but never was one - `rest` comes out of a rest-destructure, so the dependency is a
  fresh object on every render. Vue's `pendingLeaf === null` answers "has render run yet", not "did
  anything change". Angular had nothing at all.

  New engine export `createAnimatedLeafLifecycle(label)`. All four adapters now drive it and supply
  only what is genuinely theirs: WHEN to reconcile (an effect, `onUpdated`, `ngOnChanges`, a
  `$effect`) and HOW to resolve the host node. Angular additionally keeps its `whenCommitted`
  deferral, which its batched zoneless change detection requires.

  The guard compares props per key by IDENTITY against a stored SNAPSHOT, never against the caller's
  own object. That distinction is load-bearing rather than defensive: a caller may legitimately hand
  back the same object every update and mutate what its keys resolve to (Svelte's rest proxy does
  exactly this), so storing the reference would compare it with itself, read the same current values
  through both sides, and conclude nothing ever changes. The rebuild would then be skipped forever
  and a rebuilt interpolation would never reach the native graph - on device, a sticky header that
  ignores scrolling entirely.

  It is also gated on the leaf already being native, and that gate points the other way: before the
  first native connection reconcile must run on every call, because that cadence is what wires a
  rebuilt interpolation into the shared value's children. Skipping there strands the new node, its
  listener never fires, and the debounce that would have promoted the chain to native never settles.

  Only the NATIVE half of a reconcile is deferrable, via an optional `scheduleNativeBind` callback -
  Angular passes `bind => whenCommitted(node, bind)` because its batched zoneless change detection has
  no committed Fabric tag at `ngAfterViewInit`. Building the leaf and attaching it to the value graph
  is always synchronous, and that split is load-bearing rather than tidy: a deferred build sits behind
  a canceller the next reconcile drops, so a component reconciling faster than it commits attaches
  nothing at all and a sticky header's rebuilt interpolation never reaches the graph.

  Behavior is unchanged for React, Vue and Svelte beyond the guard the first two never had. No public
  component API moves.

- 388c353: Keep sticky headers correct when a cell is force-rendered. `VirtualizedList` can render a cell
  outside the normal virtualization flow — to satisfy `initialScrollIndex`, or to keep a focused row
  mounted — and the sticky-header reducer treated those cells as if they had arrived through the
  usual windowing path. The tracked header index then disagreed with what was actually mounted, and
  the wrong section header stuck (or none did) until the next ordinary scroll correction.

  The reducer now distinguishes force-rendered cells from windowed ones, and each adapter's
  `VirtualizedList` reports them as such.

## 0.3.8

### Patch Changes

- 465c9e8: Extract two triplicated component machines into shared, framework-agnostic logic in
  `@symbiote-native/components`, completing the enriched three-layer split for the last two
  components that still re-implemented decision logic per adapter.

  Touchable: the TouchableOpacity press-scheduling machine (delayPressIn defer, early-release
  flush, activatedAt tracking, min-press-duration hold) and the TouchableHighlight underlay
  gating were re-implemented line-for-line in React, Vue, and Angular. They now live once as
  `createTouchableFeedbackRuntime` + `createTouchableFeedbackHandlers` (clock and scheduler
  injected, so the machine is testable and timer globals stay out of core) and
  `highlightPressedStyle`. Each adapter keeps only the `Animated.timing` opacity call, injected
  via `activate`/`deactivate`.

  ScrollView sticky headers: the per-header effect state machine (zero-swallow gate,
  rebuild-interpolation-on-input-change, debounce pick, cross-talk feed-forward) was hand-written
  in every adapter, and twice in Angular (component plus projection wrapper). It is now one
  `reduceSticky(state, action, inputs)` enriched reducer plus a `resolveScrollForwarding` decision
  helper that absorbs the onScroll branch, throttle defaults, inverted-height capture, and the
  collapsableChildren predicate. Angular's projection wrapper collapses to a thin effect-runner
  over the same reducer. Adapters keep only effect execution: the debounce timer, the
  interpolate/listener wiring, and the re-render trigger.

  Adapter prop surfaces and runtime behavior are unchanged; the rewrite is structural.

- 465c9e8: Extract the VirtualizedList orchestration into a shared, framework-agnostic `reduceList` state
  machine in `@symbiote-native/components`. Every list adapter (React, Vue, Angular) previously
  re-implemented the same after-commit effect skeleton — window recompute, `onEndReached`/
  `onStartReached` gating, viewability, batch fill, `maintainVisibleContentPosition`, the imperative
  scrolls — in its own reactive dialect, so the decision predicates (`last === count - 1`,
  `first === 0`, the batch-fill catch-up test, the viewability guards) lived three times and could
  drift. That logic is now one pure `reduceList(state, action) -> { state, effects }`; each adapter
  only maps native events to actions, holds one state cell, and executes the returned effects. Adds
  `reduceList`, `createInitialListState`, and `listEffectSignature` (plus their types) to the public
  `@symbiote-native/components` surface. Adapter prop surfaces and runtime behavior are unchanged —
  the rewrite is structural.

## 0.3.7

### Patch Changes

- 6010442: Move `@symbiote-native/engine` from `dependencies` to `peerDependencies` (`>=0.1.0`) in every adapter and every package that imports engine internals, matching the existing `react`/`react-native` singleton-peer treatment. Engine holds module-scope singleton state — the node-identity `BRAND` symbol `isSymbioteNode`/`createElement` share, and the WeakMap-based commit mirror — that MUST be the same module instance everywhere it's touched. As a regular `dependencies` entry, each package independently resolved (and, once published via pkg.pr.new at a different point in the same session, independently pinned) its own copy of engine; inside a standalone `npm install` outside the pnpm workspace (`examples/*`), npm cannot dedupe distinct commit-pinned canary URLs, so multiple copies of engine landed side by side in `node_modules`, each with its own `BRAND` symbol.

  This surfaced as Angular's `HeaderOptionsScreen` search-bar buttons (`focus`/`setText`/`clearText`/`cancelSearch`) silently no-op'ing: `SearchBarRefDirective` reads the native node via `ElementRef.nativeElement` (created by `@symbiote-native/angular`'s own copy of `createElement`) and checks it with `@symbiote-native/navigation`'s own copy of `isSymbioteNode` — a genuine cross-package identity check that only Angular's ref-attachment shape happens to make (React/Vue's search-bar ref is a callback-prop resolved inside the SAME `createElement` call, so it never crosses a package boundary). `isSymbioteNode` returned `false` despite the object being a real, correctly-shaped native node — a different engine module's `BRAND` symbol, not a missing one — so the ref's `.current` stayed `null` forever, silently.

  Root-caused live via `mobile-mcp` device interaction (native search-bar tap fired `onFocus` correctly; imperative ref-driven buttons did not) plus a throwaway diagnostic patch of the installed `node_modules` copy dumping `Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(node).length` — confirmed exactly one (foreign) symbol present, not zero. `@symbiote-native/engine` now resolves to one singleton instance per consuming app, the same way `react`/`react-native` already do.

- 56ef0d9: Add the missing `"license": "MIT"` field to every publishable package's `package.json`. The
  `LICENSE` file itself was already shipping correctly (pnpm copies the workspace root `LICENSE`
  into a package's tarball at pack/publish time when the package has none of its own — confirmed
  against the already-published `@symbiote-native/slider@4.0.0` tarball on npm), but the
  `package.json` metadata field npm reads for the registry page's license badge and `npm install`'s
  own license check was missing on all eleven packages.

## 0.3.4

### Patch Changes

- 090c789: Fix the Metro SFC transformer crashing on a type-only `defineProps<X>()` where `X` is imported from another file (relative or bare-specifier) — `compileScript` had no `fs` access and no registered TypeScript resolver, so it threw "No fs option provided" / "TypeScript is required" instead of resolving the prop type.

## 0.3.3

### Patch Changes

- 706e52f: Fix `scripts/fix-esm-extensions.mjs` baking a literal `/index.js` extension folder-as-module directory imports (`component-names/`, `share/`, `alert/`, `platform/`, `status-bar/`, `accessibility-info/`, `linking/`, ...) that also carry `index.ios.js`/`index.android.js` siblings. Once the specifier is explicit, Metro's platform-extension layering never runs, so every platform silently resolved to the same (iOS-hardcoded, headless-fallback) file — on Android this surfaced as `Can't find ViewManager 'PullToRefreshView' nor 'RCTPullToRefreshView'` and similar wrong-native-name crashes. The script now detects platform-specific siblings and leaves those specifiers extensionless, matching react-native-builder-bob's own accepted approach for the same tension (Node ESM needs explicit extensions; Metro needs them omitted to layer `.ios`/`.android`/`.native`). Known tradeoff, same as bob: a plain headless Node/ESM import reaching one of these folders directly (bypassing Metro) will fail to resolve — nothing in this repo currently does that.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- c66082c: Fix relative imports missing file extensions in the published `build/` output, which broke every published package for real Node ESM consumers (Vitest, plain `node`, non-Metro bundlers) — `import('@symbiote-native/vue')` failed outright with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`. Metro's own resolver is lenient about missing extensions, which is why this went unnoticed until a published package's compiled output was consumed directly through Node's native ESM loader for the first time.

  The fix runs as a post-build step (`scripts/fix-esm-extensions.mjs`, wired into the root `build` script right after `typecheck`) that rewrites relative import specifiers in the already-compiled `build/**/*.js` files. It does not touch `src/*.ts` — Metro's resolver treats an explicit extension as literal (it only layers `.ios`/`.android`/`.native` suffixes on top, unlike `tsc`/Node's `.js`-maps-to-`.ts` resolution), so adding `.js` extensions directly in the TypeScript source breaks Metro's dev-mode resolution of the unbuilt source. Confirmed by reverting an earlier source-level attempt after it broke the local Vue example apps' bundling.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- b0f2568: Package Metro/Babel/tsconfig build tooling that previously only lived in the example apps, so a consuming app no longer copies files out of this repo to use these adapters.

  - `@symbiote-native/css-parser`'s `createCssMetroTransformer()` now resolves `@react-native/metro-babel-transformer` itself (a real dependency of this package) instead of requiring the caller to pass it in.
  - `@symbiote-native/vue` ships its `.vue` SFC Metro transformer as `./metro-vue-transformer` (previously only a copy-pasted file in `examples/vue-sfc`).
  - `@symbiote-native/angular` ships `./babel-linker` (wraps `@angular/compiler-cli/linker/babel`), `./tsconfig.angular.base.json` (a base config for a consumer's own `tsconfig.angular.json` to extend), `./metro-config`'s `withSymbioteAngularMetroConfig` (CSS sourceExts + the ngc-outDir style-import redirect), and a `symbiote-angular-dev` bin (a cross-platform replacement for the old per-app `dev-with-watch.sh`, running `ngc --watch` alongside `react-native start`).

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- ab42ee8: Add a zero-config host bootstrap (`bootstrapHost` in `@symbiote-native/components`, plus `registerApp` / `createApp` / `bootstrapApplication` per adapter) that wires the native-host seams and AppRegistry in one call, collapsing the manual per-app wiring every canary previously repeated.
