`TextInput` follows RN where it differed. A numeric `fontWeight` on a `Text` or `TextInput` reaches native as a string, `verticalAlign` on a `TextInput` becomes `textAlignVertical`, and an iOS multiline input without its own vertical padding gets RN's 5pt top inset.

The ref now behaves like RN's: `isFocused()` reads the app-wide focus tracker, so it is true right after `focus()` and false as soon as another input takes focus, `setSelection()` sends a null text instead of echoing the current one, and `clear()` no longer moves the mirror of the native text. It also answers `getNativeRef()`, the native node.

`TextInputState` (RN's `TextInput.State`: `focusTextInput`, `blurTextInput`, `currentlyFocusedInput`) is exported from every adapter.
